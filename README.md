## Want to say thanks?
I super appreciate getting some credit for the work, especially if you are printing a book of puzzles.
Something like “puzzles created using Maze Maker software, by Dr Warren Creemers”.

If you make something cool with it, I would love to see a photo/link.
If you make a kids book or something like that, I’d really get a kick out of getting a free copy.
Gestures like that make my day.

## Limitations:
  - Beta software (minor bugs to iron out, but quite usable)
  - Smooth edges when wall width is set to 1 are buggy.
  - Even line widths produce a better output.
  
## What is done:
  - Generates a valid maze.
  - Appearance is configurable.
  - Maze size is configurable.
  - Printing is enabled (adjust blockSize to alter print output size)
  - Zooming in, moving etc (few minor bugs still).
  - Support for DPI / block size.

## Next Release
  - Bug fixes
  - Support for graphical inserts
  - Ascii output
